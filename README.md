This project focuses on developing a structured data pipeline to preprocess, clean, and analyze customer review data. The goal is to transform raw data into a structured format suitable for further analysis, visualization, and potential machine learning applications. The dataset consists of customer reviews, including product IDs, user information, ratings, timestamps, and text reviews.
1. Data Ingestion
The first step in the pipeline involves loading the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame. The data is read from a CSV file, making it accessible for preprocessing and analysis. This stage ensures that the dataset is correctly formatted and ready for further processing.
2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Handling Missing Values: Rows containing null values are identified and removed to prevent inaccuracies in analysis.
Standardizing Column Names: Column names are stripped of extra spaces and converted to lowercase to maintain consistency.
Dropping Unnecessary Columns: Certain columns, such as lengthy text reviews, are removed to focus on structured numerical and categorical data.
Date Transformation: The time column is converted to a datetime format, and only the day component is extracted to make it more useful for time-based analysis.
3. Feature Engineering
To enhance the dataset, categorical variables such as productid, userid, and profilename are converted into numerical representations using Label Encoding. This transformation allows machine learning models and statistical analyses to interpret categorical data effectively.
4. Data Storage
Once the data is cleaned and transformed, it is saved as a structured CSV file. This ensures that the processed data is available for further use without needing to repeat the preprocessing steps.
5. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Histogram of Scores: Displays the distribution of customer ratings, helping identify trends such as whether reviews are mostly positive or negative.
Boxplot Analysis: Helps detect outliers in features like helpfulness scores, indicating variations in user interactions.
Scatter Plots: Explore relationships between numerical variables, helping to uncover potential correlations.

Results and Insights
The removal of missing values ensures a more reliable dataset.
Label encoding allows categorical features to be effectively used in further analysis.
The histogram reveals whether customer ratings are mostly positive, negative, or neutral.
Boxplots help detect outliers in helpfulness scores, providing insights into user behavior.
The dataset is now structured, cleaned, and ready for advanced analytics such as sentiment analysis, recommendation systems, or predictive modeling.

This project successfully builds an end-to-end data pipeline that transforms raw customer reviews into a structured, analyzable format. By leveraging data preprocessing techniques and visualization tools, the pipeline provides valuable insights and ensures data readiness for machine learning models. Future enhancements may include natural language processing (NLP) for text review analysis and sentiment classification to extract deeper insights into customer opinions.
